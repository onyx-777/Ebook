                RALPH STUART, Esq.</h2>
                <p>
                    My dear Mr. Stuart: I dedicate this book to you as a memento of our delightful hours of travel and work together in writing the play—“A Courier of Fortune”—founded upon this story. The circumstances of our joint literary work were as unusual to me as they were fascinating; for, although the play was commenced in London, the last “curtain” was not written until my wife and I had crossed the Atlantic and journeyed with you on a tour of over ten thousand miles of railway travelling, through so many of the marvels of this wonderful Continent. St. Louis; Denver; Salt Lake City; San Francisco; the Pacific Seaboard north to Puget Sound; the fertile Palouse Country; Washington, Idaho, and Montana—those wealthy States of boundless promise and marvellous scenic contrasts; the cities of the Lakes, Duluth and Superior; then the young giant twins, St. Paul and Minneapolis; and by way of Milwaukee and Chicago to New York. A tour of momentous interest and a collaboration of close-knit sympathy, cementing a friendship which, I assure you, is one of the pleasantest things of my life.
                </p>
                <p>Yours ever, <br>Arthur W. Marchmont.</p>

                <h2>CHAPTER I <br>
                    THE “TIGER OF MORVAIX”</h2>
                    <p>
                        HE hot noontide sun was pouring down into the market place of Morvaix and in the shadow cast by the great Cross of St. Jean in the centre, a handsome but very soberly dressed cavalier was sheltering from the fierce July heat and closely observing the townspeople as they clustered here and there to engage in eager animated discussion. Every now and then he cast sweeping impatient glances in all directions in evident search of some one whose delay irritated him.

                        It was plain even to a stranger’s eyes that the townsfolk were greatly excited, and that the reason which had drawn the people from their houses was both urgent and disturbing. All classes were present—burghers, merchants, shopkeepers, workmen, ’prentices, down to the poorest of the labourers and peasants. Men, women and children alike were gathered there; the men set-faced and bitter, the women sad and anxious. Discontent, anger, fear and sorrow were the emotions evinced among all save the many soldiers who moved among the excited knots, with leers for the women and oaths for the men, and jibes and ribald laughter one to another.
                        
                        The young cavalier’s face darkened as he listened, and more than once he started as if he would interfere, but[2] checked himself. His keen, quick blue eyes were everywhere; and presently catching sight of two closely-cowled monks clad in the black habit of their order, who showed at a secluded corner of the square, he left his shelter and went toward them quickly but cautiously.
                        
                        As he reached them one gave him a monkish greeting and the other a military salute.
                        
                        “I half feared you had forgotten the appointment,” he said, in a tone of authority; “and you are certainly forgetting your part, Pascal. Monks don’t salute like soldiers.”
                        
                        “Don’t I know it?” was the reply, laughingly spoken. “I haven’t trained all our tough fellows in the monkish drill for nothing. I’ll tell my beads against Dubois here for a stoup of wine”; and taking in hand the rosary which hung conspicuously at his side, he commenced to mumble a string of nonsense words, and laughed again.
                        
                        “Peace, man, peace!” said the other monk, much older in years. “You’ll be overheard and ruin all.”
                        
                        “Tush! they’ll only think it’s my priestly Latin.”
                        
                        “I fear I ought to have left you in Paris, Pascal,” said the cavalier. “I was warned your unruly tongue would play the mischief with a scheme that calls for tact and silence.”
                        
                        “Nay, my lord——”
                        
                        “Not, my lord, here. I am not Gerard de Bourbon for a few days. I have borrowed the name of that dicing scoundrel, Raoul de Cobalt, and am Gerard de Cobalt. Remember that, and watch your words until you have learnt that lesson.”
                        
                        “I shall not forget. This holy man here, Dubois, will keep me in order,” answered Pascal with a smile.
                        
                        “Tell me the news, Dubois.”
                        
                        “All has gone as you wished. The men have all arrived; and yesterday I sought an interview with the Governor and did all as you had directed.”
                        
                        [3]“He swallowed the bait?”
                        
                        “Readily. I told him that the Cardinal Archbishop had sent him a hundred fighting men for his troops, and craved permission for the hundred begging friars to remain in the city until the pilgrimage southward could be resumed.”
                        
                        “Good.”
                        
                        “I brought the monks in,” interposed Pascal. “A hundred tough stalwarts, every man as sober as a begging friar should be; all telling their beads with unctuous unanimity, uttering ‘Pax Vobiscum’ with fervid zeal, and praying as only Bourbons can pray—for a fight.”
                        
                        “Have a care, brother,” cried Dubois quickly, as a knot of the townsfolk passed.
                        
                        “Have I not always care, holy brother?” cried Pascal, taking his rosary in hand again and mumbling his Paternoster in tones loud enough to reach the passers’ ears. “A fine achievement, M. de Cobalt, but it will not last.”
                        
                        “What mean you?” asked Gerard quickly.
                        
                        “Soldiers are soldiers, and it takes more than a monk’s gabardine to change them. When pretty girls come buzzing round, craving ‘A blessing, holy father,’ and looking so sweet and piteous, it’s not in nature, at least in soldiers’ nature, not to kiss ’em. Cherry lips lifted in supplication are strong enemies of this new discipline. I know it myself.”
                        
                        “For shame, Pascal!” cried Dubois sternly. “Are we to betray everything for a pair of laughing eyes?”
                        
                        “Anything can happen when there’s a shapely nose, a kissable mouth, and two soft cheeks to complete the face. Let there be haste, I say, or, Bourbons or no Bourbons, those lips will get kissed; and then there may be the devil to pay.”
                        
                        “There is reason in his madcap words, Dubois,” said Gerard after a pause.
                        
                        “Aye, even a fool can tell the truth,” laughed Pascal.
                        
                        [4]“But we must wait till I have proofs. When the news of this governor’s evil doings came to my father’s ears he sent me to learn the truth; and while bidding me act as I would, enjoined me to do nothing until I had clear proofs. A Bourbon does not act on mere rumours.”
                        
                        “Proofs!” broke in Pascal with a swift change to earnestness. “In the devil’s name, what better proof of the man’s deeds could you find than that which is writ large on the wretched, starving faces of the people? Look at them—faces that the devil grins to see when he would tempt men and women to sin.”
                        
                        “I came in during the night only, and have seen little or nothing yet,” said Gerard. “What is the meaning of this gathering?”
                        
                        “This devil spawn of a governor has a new ordinance to proclaim, a new tyranny to enact,” said Pascal. “He will tax afresh to half its value every ounce of foodstuff that comes into the city. As if the poor wretches were not already half-starving. And this tax will finish them. Look at them and say if the Governor is not justly dubbed the Tiger of Morvaix? They are waiting his coming now with the heralds. Of a truth I would as lief dwell in hell as in Morvaix under Bourbon sway though it be in name, and Bourbon as I am to the core.”
                        
                        “We have had other and weightier matters to occupy us than the troubles of a small province so remote,” said Gerard, with a frown at Pascal’s words. “But if the tale of wrongs be warranted, the Governor, Duke de Rochelle though he be, will answer to me for them.”
                        
                        “By all reports he will answer to no man but himself.”
                        
                        “Enough, Pascal,” said Gerard, with a wave of the hand. “There appear to be over many soldiers, Dubois.”
                        
                        “And report says theirs are the only mouths that take enough food,” broke in Pascal. “Your fighting man must be fed, of course; but when it comes to feeding[5] him with the food for which all others starve, it is first cousin to cannibalism.”
                        
                        “The number of the soldiery has surprised me,” said Dubois seriously. “They are far too many for our small band to do much. It is well your cousin’s army lies so close to Cambrai. This governor will fight hard.”
                        
                        “If his soldiers are loyal to him, it argues in his favour,” replied Gerard thoughtfully. “We know to what lengths the burghers of a town may be driven by their jealousy of us soldiers. We must wait.”
                        
                        “And if we wait but a little while there will be no grievances left. Those who have them will be dead,” cried Pascal with a shrug of the shoulders.
                        
                        “I need no taunts of yours, Pascal, to stir me to do great Bourbon’s will,” answered Gerard with some sternness.
                        
                        “I meant no taunt, and spoke only my mind as friend to friend,” said Pascal.
                        
                        “The Governor is coming now,” put in Dubois.
                        
                        “We had better not be seen longer together. Where shall I find you at need?”
                        
                        “The Duke has lodged Pascal and myself in his castle,” answered Dubois, and the two were turning away when Gerard exclaimed, in a tone of excitement—
                        
                        “See, Dubois, see, that man riding by the side of the Governor. Do you recognize him?”
                        
                        “It is that villain, de Proballe.”
                        
                        “The old rat, so it is,” declared Pascal. “If there is devil’s work to be done in Morvaix he’ll be in it. Paris was too hot for him. I thought he was in hell by now. By the saints, he is long overdue.”
                        
                        Gerard did not wait to hear the conclusion of the speech, but mingling with the crowd watched the proceedings with close interest.
                        
                        It was a very strong force of soldiery, both horse and foot, that gathered in the market place round the[6] statue, large enough to brush away like so many flies the crowd of citizens, who fell back hushed and awe-stricken before the muskets and halberds which were used with much wilful violence.
                        
                        The Governor of the city, the Duke Charles de Rochelle, seated on his charger, a magnificent coal black Flemish animal, drew up in the centre of the cleared space, and gazed with amused contemptuousness upon the shrinking burghers.
                        
                        He made a striking centre-piece. Short and slight of figure, yet suggesting suppleness and strength, his fifty years sat lightly on him. His fair hair had scarce a touch of grey, and his pointed auburn beard and flowing moustache might have belonged to a man twenty years his junior. His features, strong and regular, would have been handsome but for the small close-set grey eyes, whose cold, hawk-like glitter was rendered additionally repulsive by a strong cast.
                        
                        “The eyes of a wild beast,” thought Gerard, who had been watching him intently. “Well named the Tiger.”
                        
                        At a signal from the Governor, the herald stepped forward amid a blare of trumpets and read the proclamation. The people listened in dead silence; but at the close, loud murmurs broke out which even the presence of the soldiery could not wholly check.
                        
                        “It means starvation to us,” cried one lusty voice, and a powerful fellow, a smith, wielding the heavy hammer of his trade, broke through the ring of the soldiers and made as if to approach the Governor.
                        
                        “What dog is this that dares to bay?” It was the Duke who spoke.
                        
                        “I am no dog, my lord, but a burgher of Morvaix, and I do but speak what all here know,” answered the smith sturdily.
                        
                        The Duke fixed his keen eyes on the man’s face, and[7] without a word signed to some of those about him. Three soldiers sprang toward the smith, who faced them fearlessly, and lifted his hammer.
                        
                        “I have done no wrong. No man shall touch me,” he said threateningly.
                        
                        “Down with the rebel dog,” cried the Duke; and at the words the soldiers, who had hesitated, rushed upon the smith. Two went down with broken heads from blows of the terrible hammer; but the third got his halberd in, and as the man lay on the ground some others dashed forward and one of them thrust home to his heart.
                        
                        “So perish all rebels,” cried the Governor, in a ringing tone to the crowd; and at the threat and the sight of the smith’s blood the people shrank together and cowered.
                        
                        The Duke smiled coldly on the crowd, and without another word signed for the procession to reform and march on, the people shrinking and cowering in silence from the troops as they passed.
                        
                        Gerard’s hot blood had fired at the scene, and he stood looking after the Governor with a heart hot with indignant anger at the foul injustice he had witnessed.
                        
                        His two followers in monkish garb crossed to him and as the three whispered together, they were startled by the sound of a woman’s wailing. It was the dead man’s wife. She had heard the news and came rushing upon the scene in wild disordered distress, carrying her babe in her arms.
                        
                        As she was nearing the body, a girl attended by a page, whose attire evidenced his mistress’ high station, met her and with tender solicitude offered such consolation as was possible.
                        
                        Gerard’s gaze, attracted by the girl’s beauty, followed the couple as together they approached the body, which[8] had now been lifted by some of the sympathizing townsfolk; and then with a cry of anger he dashed hotly toward them, followed by his companions.
                        
                        There was indeed cause for his anger. Several of the brutal soldiers had rushed upon the men carrying the corpse, and with oaths and blows and threats of the Duke’s anger, seized the body from them and flung it on the ground.
                        
                        The girl, courageously placing herself between the soldiers and the frightened townsfolk, had turned upon the former and ordered them away; but the bullies, strong in the protection of their tyrant master and presuming on their license to deal as they would with the people, first jeered at her coarsely and then thrust her roughly aside while one of them ran and kicked the corpse with wanton brutality.
                        
                        It was the attack on the girl which drove Gerard to interfere. He was by her side in an instant, flung the man who had touched her to the ground, and with eyes flashing and hand on his sword, dared the men to interfere further.
                        
                        The soldiers were still present in the square in great force, however, and attracted by the tumult many came rallying to the side of their comrades. At the same time, inspirited by Gerard’s daring, a great crowd of the townsfolk closed up behind him; and it seemed impossible that a conflict could be avoided.
                        
                        There was a moment of hesitation, however, while the two opposing bodies glared angrily at one another, and Pascal with ready wit seized it to step between them, and with uplifted crucifix threatened the soldiers with the ban of Holy Church if they attempted further violence to either dead or living.
                        
                        While he was haranguing them in loud and vehement tones, a number of men in monkish dress appeared almost as if by magic, and pushing through the citizens[9] ranged themselves at his side, thus giving an impressive background to his exhortation.
                        
                        The soldiers, abashed by this strange opposition, hung back in doubt, and the citizens having in the meanwhile borne the dead body away, the trouble ended in nothing more serious than muttered threats and oaths from the soldiers and stern remonstrances from the monks.
                        
                        When the soldiers had drawn off, Gerard turned to seek the girl the attack on whom had provoked him to interfere, but she had vanished.
                        
                        With an eagerness which brought a smile to Pascal’s face, Gerard plied those about him with questions regarding her, and learnt that she was Mademoiselle de Malincourt, and had gone away to comfort the trouble-stricken woman whose husband had been the victim of the morning’s tragedy.
                        
                        “You did shrewdly, Pascal,” said Dubois, when the two were alone.
                        
                        “Our good fellows won’t thank me, for, like myself, their fingers were tingling to be at some of the rascals’ throats. Where’s the young lord, Gerard?”
                        
                        “Gone in search of——” Pascal’s laugh interposed to finish the sentence.
                        
                        “Aye, aye. We can understand. There’s a woman in the thing now, of course. And we shall hear more of her, or I am a monk indeed, and no soldier, which God forfend.”

                        <h2>CHAPTER II <br> THE MAISON DE MALINCOURT </h2>
                        <P>
                            OME two or three hours after the scene in the market place a girl sat at her spinning wheel on the terrace of the Maison de Malincourt, opposite the head of the stately flight of steps leading down to the wide gardens. She had placed her wheel in an angle of the southern turret so that she could ply her task in comfort, protected from the rays of the July sun.

She was Lucette de Boisdegarde, the foster sister and close friend of Mademoiselle de Malincourt, for whose coming she was now waiting with as much patience as her quick vivacious temperament permitted.

Her industry was only fitful. At times her shapely little foot pressed with insistent vigour upon the treadle and the wheel flew round rapidly, as if keeping pace with the thoughts that drew her dark pretty face into a frown of petulance and made her large eyes flash with gathering purpose. But the wheel was often still and she would sit back, idly fingering the threads of gleaming flax and thinking, while her gaze would roam over the blaze of lovely flowers in the garden, or stray away to the red roofs of the city which showed through the skirting trees beyond, or rest curiously on the vacant seat at her side on the cushions of which lay some needlework.

She was in one of these preoccupied moods when her sharp ear caught the sound of a footstep. In a moment she set the treadle of her wheel whirling swiftly, while[11] she crooned to herself the air of a ballad of the time, and appeared too deeply engrossed in her work and song to have eyes or ears for anything else.

Yet young Denys St. Jean was worth looking at. Well-built he was, soldierly in bearing and self-reliant in mien, with a fair frank honest face, though now grave with thought and purpose, as he turned the corner of the Maison at a slow deliberate pace.

Seeing Lucette he started and his face brightened; and he smiled as he perceived her absorption in her task was overacted. He hesitated just an instant as if about to speak to her, but with a slight frown checked the inclination, walked on a few paces, lingered again, and then stopped.

Lucette meanwhile was treading her wheel vigorously and singing sweetly to herself—

There was once a maiden in Arcady,
Whose lover so feal and true
Came riding forth from the sullen north
Her sweet white hand to woo.
During the verse Denys stood with his back to the singer, his arms folded in an attitude suggestive of antagonism; but once or twice, when he half-turned toward her, the smile on his lips and the light in his eyes told of very different feelings.

When the song ceased he maintained his attitude of indifference, keeping his back to her and his arms still folded, waiting for her to speak; but when she gave no sign that she knew of his presence, he turned and stole up behind her softly, with a smile of expectation, and bent over her.

Her industry and absorption appeared to increase, however, and her foot pressed the treadle, the wheel flew round, and her white fingers flashed hither and[12] thither, tending the flax, gathering the thread, adjusting this and smoothing that, while all the while she crooned the old ballad.

Her patience beat him at length.

“You know I’m here,” he whispered.

“Ah, Antoine, I knew your tread.”

“Antoine!” exclaimed Denys with an angry start, “what do you mean by that, Lucette?”

The wheel stopped and she looked round, her face a pretty mask of coquettish surprise and her eyes beaming with mischief.

“So, it is not Antoine!” with just a suggestion of disappointment in the tone, a little shrug of the shapely shoulders, and a pout. “Only you. I thought you were gone for ever.”

“You will drive me away, if you treat me like this. What did you mean about knowing Antoine’s tread?”

For a second she let her roguish eyes rest on his, and then she smiled.

“His feet are so big and so clumsy,” she said, and turned again to her wheel.

“Do you mean you meet him so often you can recognize them?”

“Recognize them! Mon Dieu, they are not feet to forget when once seen,” she cried lightly.

“You can’t pass it off like that, Lucette. Were you expecting him here this afternoon? Is that what you mean?” He was still angry and his tone very earnest.

“I didn’t expect you, Monsieur Catechist.”

“And you meant to amuse yourself with him in my absence?”

She turned and made a pretty grimace of dismay and spread out her hands.

“Is it an hour since you said you would never speak to me again? What then does it matter to you? Would you play the dog in the manger?”

[13]“Will you answer my question?”

“Why do you come back at all when all is at an end between us? You said so.”

“Don’t you know why I come back?” The tone was full of feeling; but Lucette merely shrugged her shoulders.

“To see if you had made me miserable, I suppose? You have not;” and she burst again into her song, when Denys caught her by the wrist, and looked intently into her face.

“Do you mean you don’t care, Lucette?”

“I care not to have my arm bruised with your great clumsy hands. Antoine would never——”

“To hell with your Antoine!” he burst in vehemently. “You play with me as a cat with a bird;” and throwing her hand from him he turned and strode away. He got no farther than the corner of the house, and looking back saw her leaning against the wall nursing her arm as if in pain. “Forgive me, Lucette,” he cried remorsefully, hastening back. “I am a brute; you fire my blood when you make me jealous. If you love Antoine de Cavannes better than me, say so now, and let me go. But don’t torture me.”

She stood nursing her arm and looking up at him.

“Torture you, is it? Torture you?” and she held her arm up in reproach.

“You have only to say the word, and I’ll never trouble you again. It can’t be both Antoine and me. Choose!”

“Choose!” she repeated, mocking his serious tone. Then with a laugh and a change to coquettish hesitation: “Hot-tempered, handsome Denys or splay-footed, ugly Antoine, eh? It can’t be both of you, eh? And if——” She paused teasingly.

“In God’s name, can’t you be serious?”

“When I am, I’ll choose neither of you, but just[14] bury myself in a nunnery. So good-bye, my lord surly-face;” and she burst into a laugh.

“You mean that good-bye?”

“When did I wish you anything but good?”

“You’ll drive me away from you and from Morvaix,” he said angrily.

“Oh, you’ll soon be back again.”

“You think you can play with me as you will.”

“Stupid! As if I cared where you go! But you can’t leave Gabrielle. You can be many nasty things, but at least you can’t be untrue to your trust.”

His angry features relaxed somewhat at this.

“I wish I could read your heart.”

“So does Antoine.”

Angered again at this, a hot retort was stayed on his lips as Gabrielle de Malincourt stepped out of one of the tall windows of the terrace close to them.

“Ah, my good Denys, and, of course, Lucette,” she said with a smile.

“It should be the other order, mademoiselle, I fear,” he answered. “Lucette, and of course, Denys. It is Denys who is ‘of course.’”

Gabrielle glanced at them both and understood.

“Quarrelling again! Lucette, Lucette. You treat him villainously. But never mind, Denys. I know what’s in her heart whatever her lips may say.”

“Gabrielle, I——” began Lucette in protest, when Gabrielle interposed.

“Yes, yes, I know what you would say. But I am not Denys. When the sea is very calm some people like to rock a boat to make pretence; but when the storm comes in reality it’s all very different. Wait till there comes a bit of a storm, Denys, and you’ll see the truth. If Lucette had been I just now in the market place and you had been at hand, you would have seen to whom she would have turned.”

[15]“Has anything chanced, mademoiselle?” asked Denys quickly.

“That which made me wish for you, good Denys. I had visited poor old Jacques Boulanger and was returning through the market place just when the heralds had proclaimed this new and shameful ordinance of the Governor’s—a tax so cruel that it makes my blood boil. A terrible thing occurred. Babillon, the smith, sprang forward to protest, and the Governor, holding him for a rebel, had him done to death there on the spot by his brutal soldiers.”

“How horrible!” exclaimed Lucette.

“But you, mademoiselle?” asked Denys.

“I had just heard the news when his wife came rushing through the place like one distraught, and I was seeking to comfort her in her anguish when the soldiers—oh, they are fiends, those men!—attacked the citizens who had lifted the smith’s body to bear it home, flung the dead on the ground, and when, burning with indignation, I ordered them to desist, they turned on me, one of them thrust me violently aside, and would have done I know not what next, had not a cavalier, a stranger, rushed up to help me.”

“Would I had been there, mademoiselle!” exclaimed Denys angrily. “Would you know the fellow again?”

“Do you mean the stranger cavalier?” asked Lucette, with a light of mischief in her eyes.

“Nay, Lucette, do not jest,” said Gabrielle earnestly. “The man was punished for his act, Denys. The cavalier struck him to the ground and faced the whole of them fearlessly; and I dreaded for a moment that a conflict would follow, for there are not many in Morvaix who would see me harmed. But a monk intervened then and the danger was averted. Babillon’s body was carried away, and I went with the wretched woman whom I have but now left, all desolate, broken[16] and whelmed by her sorrow. These are ill days indeed for Morvaix.”

“But the men who maltreated you, mademoiselle, can be found, nay, must be found and punished,” cried Denys warmly.

“It is of no matter now, Denys. It is over; beside the cruel wrongs done to the people, my little hurt is nothing. These soldiers, moreover, are but hirelings, and do no more than hirelings’ work. But there is one quest—you must find the cavalier who served me.”

Lucette looked up.

“You learnt his name, Gabrielle?” she asked quickly.

“Nay, for I left the place with Babillon’s wife—wife alas! no more, but widow, poor soul.”

“The cavalier, Gabrielle, was he handsome as well as brave?” asked Lucette after a pause.

A faint tinge of colour tinted Gabrielle’s cheeks as she answered.

“In truth, I scarce had time to see, Lucette; but he seemed in all respects a manly man, a figure of distinction truly. Tall and knightly in mien; his face unbearded and full of strength, yet kindly and courteous; fair in colouring; and his blue eyes, keen and flashing fire as he faced the soldiery, were gentle and solicitous when viewing my plight; his voice resolute with the tone of one accustomed to command; yet tuned to gentle accents, as it seemed to me. I much mistake me if he be not a knight of loftier station than his sober brown attire would seem to bespeak him. A most gallant gentleman and a brave heart.”

“You saw much, cousin, it seems, although you had no time, as you say;” and Lucette, with a smile to herself, turned to her spinning wheel.

“I will seek him out, mademoiselle,” said Denys, “and no doubt shall find him. Shall I give him any message?”

[17]“I could not even stay to thank him, and would wish to do so. Let him know as much.”

“Before I go, there is a grave matter on which I would speak with you.”

“Not now, Denys, but afterward. He must not think Gabrielle de Malincourt ungrateful. I beg you hasten at once in quest of him.”

“I will go,” he answered, and turning toward Lucette, said nervously: “Lucette, I——”

“We can finish our quarrel when you return,” she interposed. “I may forgive you if you do Gabrielle’s service quickly.” Her tone was one of indifference, but he read the smile in her eyes and went with a light quick step upon his errand.

Gabrielle had dropped into the vacant seat by Lucette and now leant back thinking, her lips slightly parted and her eyes dreamy.

“He was a handsome man, coz, this cavalier of yours?” Gabrielle started at the question and then met her friend’s half-quizzing look calmly.

“I have never seen a nobler, Lucette. I hope our good Denys will find him. Why do you plague that good fellow so sorely?”

“Nay, it is he plagues me. He is always quarrelling.”

“You are always finding cause to make him, you mean?”

“He is a man, and must be kept in his place;” and Lucette shrugged her shoulders.

“By bickering and teasing and wrangling? Does it please you?”

“There is always the making up again;” and Lucette laughed roguishly.

“Beware how you try him too much. He is sterling mettle.” She paused and suppressed a sigh as she added: “How happy you should be!”

[18]Lucette glanced across at her and her manner changed.

“You are thinking again, Gabrielle. You are not sad?”

“Yes, I was thinking. I ought not to be sad, to-day of all days; and yet——” The rest of the sentence was an unmistakable sigh, deep and sincere.

“He may prove a gallant cavalier, Gabrielle, your Gerard; as gallant maybe as your hero of the market place. Don’t look like that, dear.”

“I am afraid, Lucette, horribly afraid. You cannot tell how it is with me. I am perhaps overwrought by this terrible scene in the market place, and—oh, I know not what I feel;” and with a shudder she covered her face with her hands.

“It will all come right, dear,” whispered Lucette gently, after a pause; but the words seemed to jar upon Gabrielle, who lowered her hands, and with a look of irritation replied almost petulantly.

“You judge from your own little outlook. You tease Denys and force a sham quarrel, knowing he will make it up and all will come right, as you say. But how would it be with you if you were in my place, given to a man you had not seen since you were a child; betrothed to one you know nothing about, and who may turn out to be—oh, what am I saying?”

“I should hate him before he came to claim me, Gabrielle,” said Lucette vigorously, tearing at the flax she held in her fingers. “Claim me!” she added, incensed by her own word. “I would make him feel that the claiming was no easy task. Oh, I should hate him! But you need not wed him. You are the mistress of Malincourt.”

“You do not understand, Lucette.” The girl looked up in genuine surprise at the change in Gabrielle’s tone, suddenly calm, proud and cold. “It is my duty to my[19] family. My parents ordered it so, and it is not for me to disobey. I owe it to my house.”

“I can’t understand you, Gabrielle. At one moment you are a girl with all a girl’s heart and feelings, and the next, you are the grand dame, cold, passionless, proud—just the embodied spirit of the traditions of your house.”

“Were you a Malincourt you would understand. I have to live my life and must perforce be content.”

“But pride makes an ill substitute for love in a marriage, Gabrielle. And your motive is pride. If this M. Gerard de Cobalt, this distant kinsman and unseen betrothed, should turn out to be a hideous depraved wretch——”

“Peace, Lucette; you do but plague me. M. de Cobalt will be here to-day or to-morrow; and you will remember he is my affianced husband.”

“I am sorry my reckless tongue wounds you, Gabrielle. I love you so dearly;” and Lucette bent across and kissed her tenderly. “Pray God it may all be well with you. Forgive me.”

“There is nothing to forgive, dear,” answered Gabrielle sweetly. “You are right. I have two natures; and if the girl in me rebels sometimes, it is kinder to check than to encourage rebellion. To-day, somehow, it is harder than usual to check it. I shall be glad when M. de Cobalt comes. My uncle gives me good account of him, and speaks of him as brave and gallant.”

“Does M. de Proballe know him?”

“No, he has never seen him—at least not for many years; but he has heard much of him, and from what he says all should be well.”

“From what he says,” commented Lucette, with a little frown of disdain.

“You trouble me, Lucette, with these reflections on[20] my uncle. You do not like him, and so would have me share your feeling. We’ll say no more;” and with a sigh she leant back to think.

Lucette, seeing her mood, resumed her work and set her wheel speeding busily on; but chancing to glance round a moment later she stopped abruptly with an exclamation of surprise which attracted Gabrielle’s attention.

A man was standing close behind Gabrielle’s chair in an attitude of excessive humility. He bowed low and spread out his hands as she turned to him, while an expressive curl of contempt drew down the corners of Lucette’s mouth.

“What is it? Why did you not say you were here?” asked Gabrielle sharply.

“I feared to interrupt miladi, and was awaiting your permission to speak my errand.” His voice was soft and his manner deferential.

“What is it? Speak.”

“My master, the Baron de Proballe, desires to know if it is convenient for him to wait upon you, miladi?”

“My uncle? Certainly. Where is he?”

“At present in his apartments, miladi.”

“Tell him I will see him at once.”

“I am miladi’s most humble servant,” was the reply with another deep bow, as he went.

“What a loathsome snake is that Master Dauban,” exclaimed Lucette, looking after him.

“My uncle says he is a very honest fellow and as faithful as a man can be.”

“I should need a higher character than that,” said Lucette with another very expressive shrug.

“The Baron de Proballe is my uncle, Lucette,” replied Gabrielle in a tone of reproach, as she rose to go into the house. And Lucette, by way of reply, turned her head away with a toss and made a grimace to herself as she bent over her wheel.

                            “And you meant to amuse yourself with him in my absence?”
                            
                            She turned and made a pretty grimace of dismay and spread out her hands.
                            
                            “Is it an hour since you said you would never speak to me again? What then does it matter to you? Would you play the dog in the manger?”
                            
                            [13]“Will you answer my question?”
                            
                            “Why do you come back at all when all is at an end between us? You said so.”
                            
                            “Don’t you know why I come back?” The tone was full of feeling; but Lucette merely shrugged her shoulders.
                            
                            “To see if you had made me miserable, I suppose? You have not;” and she burst again into her song, when Denys caught her by the wrist, and looked intently into her face.
                            
                            “Do you mean you don’t care, Lucette?”
                            
                            “I care not to have my arm bruised with your great clumsy hands. Antoine would never——”
                            
                            “To hell with your Antoine!” he burst in vehemently. “You play with me as a cat with a bird;” and throwing her hand from him he turned and strode away. He got no farther than the corner of the house, and looking back saw her leaning against the wall nursing her arm as if in pain. “Forgive me, Lucette,” he cried remorsefully, hastening back. “I am a brute; you fire my blood when you make me jealous. If you love Antoine de Cavannes better than me, say so now, and let me go. But don’t torture me.”
                            
                            She stood nursing her arm and looking up at him.
                            
                            “Torture you, is it? Torture you?” and she held her arm up in reproach.
                            
                            “You have only to say the word, and I’ll never trouble you again. It can’t be both Antoine and me. Choose!”
                            
                            “Choose!” she repeated, mocking his serious tone. Then with a laugh and a change to coquettish hesitation: “Hot-tempered, handsome Denys or splay-footed, ugly Antoine, eh? It can’t be both of you, eh? And if——” She paused teasingly.
                            
                            “In God’s name, can’t you be serious?”
                            
                            “When I am, I’ll choose neither of you, but just[14] bury myself in a nunnery. So good-bye, my lord surly-face;” and she burst into a laugh.
                            
                            “You mean that good-bye?”
                            
                            “When did I wish you anything but good?”
                            
                            “You’ll drive me away from you and from Morvaix,” he said angrily.
                            
                            “Oh, you’ll soon be back again.”
                            
                            “You think you can play with me as you will.”
                            
                            “Stupid! As if I cared where you go! But you can’t leave Gabrielle. You can be many nasty things, but at least you can’t be untrue to your trust.”
                            
                            His angry features relaxed somewhat at this.
                            
                            “I wish I could read your heart.”
                            
                            “So does Antoine.”
                            
                            Angered again at this, a hot retort was stayed on his lips as Gabrielle de Malincourt stepped out of one of the tall windows of the terrace close to them.
                            
                            “Ah, my good Denys, and, of course, Lucette,” she said with a smile.
                            
                            “It should be the other order, mademoiselle, I fear,” he answered. “Lucette, and of course, Denys. It is Denys who is ‘of course.’”
                            
                            Gabrielle glanced at them both and understood.
                            
                            “Quarrelling again! Lucette, Lucette. You treat him villainously. But never mind, Denys. I know what’s in her heart whatever her lips may say.”
                            
                            “Gabrielle, I——” began Lucette in protest, when Gabrielle interposed.
                            
                            “Yes, yes, I know what you would say. But I am not Denys. When the sea is very calm some people like to rock a boat to make pretence; but when the storm comes in reality it’s all very different. Wait till there comes a bit of a storm, Denys, and you’ll see the truth. If Lucette had been I just now in the market place and you had been at hand, you would have seen to whom she would have turned.”
                            
                            [15]“Has anything chanced, mademoiselle?” asked Denys quickly.
                            
                            “That which made me wish for you, good Denys. I had visited poor old Jacques Boulanger and was returning through the market place just when the heralds had proclaimed this new and shameful ordinance of the Governor’s—a tax so cruel that it makes my blood boil. A terrible thing occurred. Babillon, the smith, sprang forward to protest, and the Governor, holding him for a rebel, had him done to death there on the spot by his brutal soldiers.”
                            
                            “How horrible!” exclaimed Lucette.
                            
                            “But you, mademoiselle?” asked Denys.
                            
                            “I had just heard the news when his wife came rushing through the place like one distraught, and I was seeking to comfort her in her anguish when the soldiers—oh, they are fiends, those men!—attacked the citizens who had lifted the smith’s body to bear it home, flung the dead on the ground, and when, burning with indignation, I ordered them to desist, they turned on me, one of them thrust me violently aside, and would have done I know not what next, had not a cavalier, a stranger, rushed up to help me.”
                            
                            “Would I had been there, mademoiselle!” exclaimed Denys angrily. “Would you know the fellow again?”
                            
                            “Do you mean the stranger cavalier?” asked Lucette, with a light of mischief in her eyes.
                            
                            “Nay, Lucette, do not jest,” said Gabrielle earnestly. “The man was punished for his act, Denys. The cavalier struck him to the ground and faced the whole of them fearlessly; and I dreaded for a moment that a conflict would follow, for there are not many in Morvaix who would see me harmed. But a monk intervened then and the danger was averted. Babillon’s body was carried away, and I went with the wretched woman whom I have but now left, all desolate, broken[16] and whelmed by her sorrow. These are ill days indeed for Morvaix.”
                            
                            “But the men who maltreated you, mademoiselle, can be found, nay, must be found and punished,” cried Denys warmly.
                            
                            “It is of no matter now, Denys. It is over; beside the cruel wrongs done to the people, my little hurt is nothing. These soldiers, moreover, are but hirelings, and do no more than hirelings’ work. But there is one quest—you must find the cavalier who served me.”
                            
                            Lucette looked up.
                            
                            “You learnt his name, Gabrielle?” she asked quickly.
                            
                            “Nay, for I left the place with Babillon’s wife—wife alas! no more, but widow, poor soul.”
                            
                            “The cavalier, Gabrielle, was he handsome as well as brave?” asked Lucette after a pause.
                            
                            A faint tinge of colour tinted Gabrielle’s cheeks as she answered.
                            
                            “In truth, I scarce had time to see, Lucette; but he seemed in all respects a manly man, a figure of distinction truly. Tall and knightly in mien; his face unbearded and full of strength, yet kindly and courteous; fair in colouring; and his blue eyes, keen and flashing fire as he faced the soldiery, were gentle and solicitous when viewing my plight; his voice resolute with the tone of one accustomed to command; yet tuned to gentle accents, as it seemed to me. I much mistake me if he be not a knight of loftier station than his sober brown attire would seem to bespeak him. A most gallant gentleman and a brave heart.”
                            
                            “You saw much, cousin, it seems, although you had no time, as you say;” and Lucette, with a smile to herself, turned to her spinning wheel.
                            
                            “I will seek him out, mademoiselle,” said Denys, “and no doubt shall find him. Shall I give him any message?”
                            
                            [17]“I could not even stay to thank him, and would wish to do so. Let him know as much.”
                            
                            “Before I go, there is a grave matter on which I would speak with you.”
                            
                            “Not now, Denys, but afterward. He must not think Gabrielle de Malincourt ungrateful. I beg you hasten at once in quest of him.”
                            
                            “I will go,” he answered, and turning toward Lucette, said nervously: “Lucette, I——”
                            
                            “We can finish our quarrel when you return,” she interposed. “I may forgive you if you do Gabrielle’s service quickly.” Her tone was one of indifference, but he read the smile in her eyes and went with a light quick step upon his errand.
                            
                            Gabrielle had dropped into the vacant seat by Lucette and now leant back thinking, her lips slightly parted and her eyes dreamy.
                            
                            “He was a handsome man, coz, this cavalier of yours?” Gabrielle started at the question and then met her friend’s half-quizzing look calmly.
                            
                            “I have never seen a nobler, Lucette. I hope our good Denys will find him. Why do you plague that good fellow so sorely?”
                            
                            “Nay, it is he plagues me. He is always quarrelling.”
                            
                            “You are always finding cause to make him, you mean?”
                            
                            “He is a man, and must be kept in his place;” and Lucette shrugged her shoulders.
                            
                            “By bickering and teasing and wrangling? Does it please you?”
                            
                            “There is always the making up again;” and Lucette laughed roguishly.
                            
                            “Beware how you try him too much. He is sterling mettle.” She paused and suppressed a sigh as she added: “How happy you should be!”
                            
                            [18]Lucette glanced across at her and her manner changed.
                            
                            “You are thinking again, Gabrielle. You are not sad?”
                            
                            “Yes, I was thinking. I ought not to be sad, to-day of all days; and yet——” The rest of the sentence was an unmistakable sigh, deep and sincere.
                            
                            “He may prove a gallant cavalier, Gabrielle, your Gerard; as gallant maybe as your hero of the market place. Don’t look like that, dear.”
                            
                            “I am afraid, Lucette, horribly afraid. You cannot tell how it is with me. I am perhaps overwrought by this terrible scene in the market place, and—oh, I know not what I feel;” and with a shudder she covered her face with her hands.
                            
                            “It will all come right, dear,” whispered Lucette gently, after a pause; but the words seemed to jar upon Gabrielle, who lowered her hands, and with a look of irritation replied almost petulantly.
                            
                            “You judge from your own little outlook. You tease Denys and force a sham quarrel, knowing he will make it up and all will come right, as you say. But how would it be with you if you were in my place, given to a man you had not seen since you were a child; betrothed to one you know nothing about, and who may turn out to be—oh, what am I saying?”
                            
                            “I should hate him before he came to claim me, Gabrielle,” said Lucette vigorously, tearing at the flax she held in her fingers. “Claim me!” she added, incensed by her own word. “I would make him feel that the claiming was no easy task. Oh, I should hate him! But you need not wed him. You are the mistress of Malincourt.”
                            
                            “You do not understand, Lucette.” The girl looked up in genuine surprise at the change in Gabrielle’s tone, suddenly calm, proud and cold. “It is my duty to my[19] family. My parents ordered it so, and it is not for me to disobey. I owe it to my house.”
                            
                            “I can’t understand you, Gabrielle. At one moment you are a girl with all a girl’s heart and feelings, and the next, you are the grand dame, cold, passionless, proud—just the embodied spirit of the traditions of your house.”
                            
                            “Were you a Malincourt you would understand. I have to live my life and must perforce be content.”
                            
                            “But pride makes an ill substitute for love in a marriage, Gabrielle. And your motive is pride. If this M. Gerard de Cobalt, this distant kinsman and unseen betrothed, should turn out to be a hideous depraved wretch——”
                            
                            “Peace, Lucette; you do but plague me. M. de Cobalt will be here to-day or to-morrow; and you will remember he is my affianced husband.”
                            
                            “I am sorry my reckless tongue wounds you, Gabrielle. I love you so dearly;” and Lucette bent across and kissed her tenderly. “Pray God it may all be well with you. Forgive me.”
                            
                            “There is nothing to forgive, dear,” answered Gabrielle sweetly. “You are right. I have two natures; and if the girl in me rebels sometimes, it is kinder to check than to encourage rebellion. To-day, somehow, it is harder than usual to check it. I shall be glad when M. de Cobalt comes. My uncle gives me good account of him, and speaks of him as brave and gallant.”
                            
                            “Does M. de Proballe know him?”
                            
                            “No, he has never seen him—at least not for many years; but he has heard much of him, and from what he says all should be well.”
                            
                            “From what he says,” commented Lucette, with a little frown of disdain.
                            
                            “You trouble me, Lucette, with these reflections on[20] my uncle. You do not like him, and so would have me share your feeling. We’ll say no more;” and with a sigh she leant back to think.
                            
                            Lucette, seeing her mood, resumed her work and set her wheel speeding busily on; but chancing to glance round a moment later she stopped abruptly with an exclamation of surprise which attracted Gabrielle’s attention.
                            
                            A man was standing close behind Gabrielle’s chair in an attitude of excessive humility. He bowed low and spread out his hands as she turned to him, while an expressive curl of contempt drew down the corners of Lucette’s mouth.
                            
                            “What is it? Why did you not say you were here?” asked Gabrielle sharply.
                            
                            “I feared to interrupt miladi, and was awaiting your permission to speak my errand.” His voice was soft and his manner deferential.
                            
                            “What is it? Speak.”
                            
                            “My master, the Baron de Proballe, desires to know if it is convenient for him to wait upon you, miladi?”
                            
                            “My uncle? Certainly. Where is he?”
                            
                            “At present in his apartments, miladi.”
                            
                            “Tell him I will see him at once.”
                            
                            “I am miladi’s most humble servant,” was the reply with another deep bow, as he went.
                            
                            “What a loathsome snake is that Master Dauban,” exclaimed Lucette, looking after him.
                            
                            “My uncle says he is a very honest fellow and as faithful as a man can be.”
                            
                            “I should need a higher character than that,” said Lucette with another very expressive shrug.
                            
                            “The Baron de Proballe is my uncle, Lucette,” replied Gabrielle in a tone of reproach, as she rose to go into the house. And Lucette, by way of reply, turned her head away with a toss and made a grimace to herself as she bent over her wheel.

                                    THE DUKE’S PROPOSAL</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        HERE was one very bitter heart in the maison on the following morning. Jacques Dauban had spent a bad night, groaning over aching bones and head, brooding over his wrongs and setting his cunning wits to work to devise a scheme of revenge.

                                        Very ill results had followed that meeting with Lucette in the pine-walk. She had kept the tryst and had wheedled out of him a part of what he knew. He had not told her much; only warned her to do her utmost to prevent the marriage between Gabrielle and Gerard de Cobalt, hinting at dark deeds of which he dared not speak, and denouncing Gerard as both an unscrupulous scoundrel and a tool in the hands of others greater and more villainous even than he.
                                        
                                        She might have got more from him, but it chanced that Denys St. Jean had also conceived a fancy for a stroll in the wood, and had come suddenly upon the pair in close and intimate talk. His quick temper had fired instantly, and the consequences to Jacques Dauban had been serious. Denys was strong in the arm, and his cudgel, snatched hastily from a tree, thick and heavy; and there was scarcely a bone in the writhing, wriggling spy’s body which did not ache and stab and pain.
                                        
                                        And Lucette had laughed.
                                        
                                        The laugh was the worst of all. It was in his ears all through the paining hours of the night; maddening him, taunting him, and goading him almost to a frenzy of wrath and spite. He read it as the proof that she had fooled him; that she had laid the trap to bring the[34] hot-headed devil upon him; and had planned his humiliation and beating.
                                        
                                        He would be revenged; and as he twisted and turned and groaned in an anguish of mind even more than of body, a scheme came to him; and in the congenial task of working it out and maturing it, his own sufferings were more than half forgotten.
                                        
                                        His first thought had been to lay in wait for Denys and, catching him unawares, to thrust a dagger between his ribs swiftly from behind; but there was too much risk. He might fail to strike true, and then—the horrible fear of what would happen to himself in such a case killed the plan at once.
                                        
                                        The next thought was to hire some one in Morvaix to do what he with his own hand was afraid to attempt, but his cunning made him hesitate to place himself in any other’s power. And so that idea had in its turn to be abandoned.
                                        
                                        But out of it had come the scheme which he saw was at once safe and sure. He would remain in the background all unsuspected even by Lucette, and might mask his work in any way he wished; and yet Denys would die as surely as if his was the hand which plunged the dagger home to his heart. Aye, much more surely.
                                        
                                        He would tell the Baron de Proballe that Denys had in some way got scent of the scheme which had been laid against Gabrielle and that he meant to divulge it to her.
                                        
                                        He had some ground to believe this, moreover. Earlier in the day Denys had put some searching questions to him, had hinted at ugly rumours, and asked significantly about strange letters which had passed between de Cobalt and his master. And Dauban knew the latter well enough to be sure what would happen. The Baron would tell the Duke, and the tiger of a Governor would find means to silence Denys for ever.
                                        
                                        [35]And when Denys was dead, he would tell Lucette that it was his hand that secretly had killed him; and that mocking laugh of hers would change to a gasp of fear of him. That would be something like a revenge, and he gloated in fancy over the picture of Lucette’s fear-stricken face when she knew.
                                        
                                        “Let her laugh then, if she can,” he said to himself; and when the hour came for him to go to his master, he had his tale ready and told it artfully with a hundred touches which all calculated to appeal to de Proballe’s imagination and spur his alarm.
                                        
                                        “How know you this, Jacques?” asked de Proballe, when he had heard the news.
                                        
                                        “I overheard him last night speaking to Mademoiselle Lucette and saying he had grave news which he must tell miladi at once about M. de Cobalt.”
                                        
                                        “That may not mean what you say.”
                                        
                                        “I fear that it did, m’sieu. The two are lovers, it seems, and like a woman she was trying to wheedle the facts out of him. He was loath to tell her and sought to put her off; but she got something from him. He said M. de Cobalt was a scoundrel—he has a scurrilous tongue this Denys—and, saving your presence, m’sieu, he said that de Cobalt was but a tool in the hands of greater scoundrels. Shamed I am that my lips should have to speak the words, but your lordship must know the truth—he named you and His Grace the Duke de Rochelle.”
                                        
                                        “In the devil’s name, this is serious then,” exclaimed de Proballe angrily. “How much does he know?”
                                        
                                        “Indeed, m’sieu, I cannot say. He hinted at an intercepted letter, but he was called away soon. I can only infer he has made an important discovery. But the girl was terribly alarmed.”
                                        
                                        “It may ruin everything. Have you breathed a whisper to a soul?”
                                        
                                        “Have I served you all these years to betray you?”[36] and he spread his hands out and spoke as if in sorrow that such a suspicion should even be named. “That she suspects something I know to be true indeed.”
                                        
                                        “Tell me. Quick, Jacques, I am uneasy.”
                                        
                                        “Purposefully I put myself in her way, m’sieu. She is a pretty girl enough and thinks, forsooth, that all men can be wheedled by her glances. She led round artfully to the subject and plied me with questions, all inspired, as I could see, by what this Denys had told her. She did not find me easy to draw, m’sieu,” and he smiled with deprecating reference to his secrecy. “But ’twas easy to see what was in her thoughts.”
                                        
                                        “She may also be a source of danger. She may tell Gabrielle,” exclaimed de Proballe quickly. “By Heaven; the thing must be stopped.”
                                        
                                        But it was not Dauban’s wish to have Lucette harmed, so he made haste to check this thought.
                                        
                                        “Of herself she knows nothing, m’sieu; all hangs on the man’s story, and if both of them were removed from Malincourt, might not miladi herself take fright?”
                                        
                                        “A shrewd thought, Jacques. We must deal with the man alone. Do you think he can have seen my niece yet?”
                                        
                                        “No, m’sieu, I am sure. I watched him closely. But this morning he may seek her—nay, he will do so. He said as much.”
                                        
                                        “He must not,” exclaimed de Proballe earnestly. “At any cost that must be prevented.”
                                        
                                        “It will be difficult, m’sieu, but should not be impossible.”
                                        
                                        “You have a thought, I see. Speak it.”
                                        
                                        “It is not for me to offer counsel to you, m’sieu. But yesterday there was a cavalier who afforded some assistance to miladi in the market place. She is anxious to find him, and sent this Denys yesterday in search of him. If you could have knowledge that the stranger was to[37] be found, say at some place a few leagues away, it might be possible to despatch Denys thither in quest of him, and thus enable time and perchance provide means and opportunity to deal with him. Miladi would appreciate any effort to find the cavalier, and some of the roads around Morvaix are not over-safe.”
                                        
                                        “You have a cunning brain, Jacques,” exclaimed de Proballe suddenly, with a sharp glance at his secretary. “Have you aught against this Denys?”
                                        
                                        Dauban did not shrink from the scrutiny, but answered deferentially—
                                        
                                        “If my lord thinks I should place my feelings before my duty to him, I have served him uselessly all these years.”
                                        
                                        “I don’t think it, Jacques. You too well know on which side your interest lies, and you know also that I should not be a pleasant man to betray.”
                                        
                                        “I am naught if not your faithful servant, my lord,” replied Dauban. He knew he had said enough for his purpose and that his master would adopt the suggestion he had let fall. The seed he had sown would bear fruit; and he was astute enough not to appear too anxious and thus reveal his personal feelings.
                                        
                                        His plan was carried out. De Proballe sent for Denys, and after inquiring about the guest of the previous day he said he had news that the cavalier could be found at Beaucamp, an estate some four leagues west of Morvaix. He expressed his desire to please and surprise Gabrielle by finding the stranger, and also spoke feelingly about the honour of the family being concerned to thank the stranger for the service rendered to its young head, and thus despatched Denys on the mission before he could get a word with Gabrielle.
                                        
                                        As soon as he had seen him start, he hurried with his news to the castle, had an earnest interview with the Duke, and returned to Malincourt without Gabrielle even[38] knowing of his absence. Thus the train was all laid when at noon the Governor, in accordance with the arrangement of the previous day, came to wait upon Gabrielle.
                                        
                                        “You have made all arrangements?” was de Proballe’s greeting when they met for a moment and were going to Gabrielle.
                                        
                                        “I am not likely to fail, m’sieu,” was the drily-spoken reply. “Antoine de Cavannes and Henri d’Estelle have ridden out, and know me better than to return with any mission unfulfilled. My men serve me well or do not serve me long.”
                                        
                                        The next minute he was bowing over Gabrielle’s hand, which he would have carried to his lips had she not adroitly and with unseeming intention prevented him.
                                        
                                        “The sun never shines for me, mademoiselle, when I have no chance to look into your eyes,” he murmured, with glances of bold, almost aggressive admiration.
                                        
                                        Words and glance were alike detestable to Gabrielle.
                                        
                                        “Your lordship is pleased to flatter, but flattery does not please me,” she returned with a smile.
                                        
                                        “It is no flattery, but the truth,” he protested, his hand on his heart. “Your beauty is the fairest thing the earth holds for me.”
                                        
                                        “The good opinion of the husband of my dear friend, the Duchess de Rochelle, must of course be ever welcome, but I beg you to burden it with less wealth of language.”
                                        
                                        At the reference to his wife the Duke frowned, as he took a seat near her.
                                        
                                        “We see too little of you, mademoiselle,” he said next, “and rumour says you are often to be found in many of the humble houses in Morvaix.”
                                        
                                        “Alas! my lord, there is much distress and poverty among the people, and Holy Church requires that those who can should minister to them.”
                                        
                                        [39]“Holy Church should do the work more thoroughly. I hold not with this constant tending and pampering of those whose chief employment seems to be to breed discontent.”
                                        
                                        “They have unhappily but too much cause for discontent,” said Gabrielle firmly. “You have considered the petition which I ventured to send to you?”
                                        
                                        He smiled indulgently.
                                        
                                        “What do you know of these things?”
                                        
                                        “My own eyes have seen their distress, their want, their sufferings. Men workless and despairing, women hopeless and languishing, children starving and crying for the food which the parents cannot give them. We who are rich and have plenty can but scantily measure the pain of those in want. Even when we see it for ourselves we cannot realize all its misery; and those of us who never see it cannot even believe in its existence.”
                                        
                                        “Would you have me don a monk’s garb, then, and turn bread carrier to a set of worthless wastrels?” asked the Governor half in anger, half in sardonic humour.
                                        
                                        “Nay, my lord, it is in no such spirit I would approach you. But you have the power to administer relief which all others lack. I would but have you recognize the evil and apply the remedy.”
                                        
                                        “You make a beautiful advocate, Mistress Gabrielle, and you, if anyone, can work your will with me. I would gladly see these things with your eyes—to please you,” he said with a meaning glance.
                                        
                                        “I am but of small account, and to please me is a very little thing, and at best a poor motive for doing right.”
                                        
                                        “It would be my only motive, poor or rich. But I fear you understand the art of government but ill. We must have money to administer the town. We must have troops, and troops must be paid and fed, fair advocate.”
                                        
                                        “Why? Is force in the hand of the ruler a surer[40] foundation of rule than content and prosperity among the ruled?”
                                        
                                        “The world cannot wag without soldiers, mademoiselle, and Morvaix can only be ruled by force.”
                                        
                                        “Must a populace be starved that the soldiers may be fat? If I seem to speak boldly, it is because I feel deeply. And if I offend, I crave your pardon, monsieur.”
                                        
                                        “Nothing you could say or do could ever offend me, Mademoiselle Gabrielle. With you I am as clay in the hands of the potter.”
                                        
                                        “Nay, if you put it merely on grounds personal to myself, I can urge nothing,” said Gabrielle, sadly and reluctantly.
                                        
                                        “Yet they are the only grounds that will prevail with me,” he answered. “The lot of these people is much to you, you say; then you would of a surety make sacrifices to help them? Is it not so?”
                                        
                                        “I would do anything in my power,” she said warmly.
                                        
                                        “That remains to be proved,” he retorted, smiling as he looked searchingly at her. “Perhaps I may take that as a challenge and put you to a test. Your petition here”—he drew it out and opened it. “You urge me to recall this last ordinance of mine and take off the new imposts on food.”
                                        
                                        “The people will starve if you do not, monsieur.”
                                        
                                        “Well, let them starve, then. I must have money, and money can only be raised by such means. But if I were to grant you this favour, make this sacrifice for you, what sacrifice would you make in your turn, what favour would you grant me?”
                                        
                                        His eyes were glowing as he turned them upon her while waiting for her reply.
                                        
                                        “I do not understand your lordship,” said Gabrielle, meeting his glance with her calm innocent gaze.
                                        
                                        [41]“Or is it that you will not?” he asked insolently. “Supposing I agree that your influence shall prevail with me and that in the government of Morvaix you and I shall act together: you inspiring with your lofty motives, I executing with the powers at my command. If we try it for a year, two years, three years—any time you like to fix—what would be my reward?”
                                        
                                        “The rich gratitude of a contented people, the respect of every man in Morvaix; hope in place of despair, prosperity instead of want, love where fear now lurks.”
                                        
                                        “Pshaw! I do not seek the love of such canaille, a mouthing mob as ready to shout ‘Crucify’ as ‘Hosanna!’ What reward would you yourself grant?”
                                        
                                        “I should for ever bless and admire you.”
                                        
                                        “For ever is a long, indefinite time, and blessings and admiration may be but cold emotions. What would you do?” and he once more fixed his bold eyes upon her face.
                                        
                                        “Again I say I do not understand what your lordship would have me say.”
                                        
                                        He paused in thought and then laughed abruptly, almost grimly.
                                        
                                        “It is enough,” he exclaimed, with a wave of the hand. “The thought pleases me, for I would gladly please you; believe that I will grant your petition——”
                                        
                                        “Oh, I thank you—” she burst in, when he checked her.
                                        
                                        “Wait. I will grant it if you will fall in with my plan, will lend me your aid in the perilous task of government; will work with me and inspire me with your sweet counsel; and if you will consider what favour you will grant me in return. I will have my answer in a week from now, and until then we speak no more of this. Now I have to offer you my congratulations upon your approaching marriage, in which I take deep interest.”
                                        
                                        [42]He rose shortly afterwards, and when Gabrielle held her hand to him he carried it to his lips.
                                        
                                        “Remember,” he said, retaining her hand and looking up, his face quite close to hers. “Remember, we have made a compact, and you must make the offer worthy of my acceptance—or it may mean fresh and heavier imposts for your favourites in place of lighter ones,” and with that smiling, half-jesting menace he went away, calling the Baron de Proballe to attend him.
                                        
                                        Gabrielle stood gazing after him sorely bewildered by what had passed, distracted by doubts and striving earnestly to fathom the meaning of the question he had pressed with such insistence.
                                        
                                        When he had gone she went to an inner room, accompanied by Lucette who had been present at the interview but out of earshot, and had followed the strange proceedings, watching the Duke intently and reading there something of the purpose which was hidden from Gabrielle’s unsuspecting nature.
                                        
                                        Lucette was skilled in reading love in the eyes of men, and with quaking heart and fearsome curiosity she waited now to hear what words the Duke had spoken to Gabrielle to inspire the looks which she had seen him cast upon her. And when she heard them, Lucette felt her cheeks alternately flame with rage and chill with deadly fear for Gabrielle’s sake.
                                        
                                        </p>

                                            THE TIGER’S CLAWS</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                UCETTE had had her own troubles as well. Never before had such a mischance occurred as that of the previous evening in the pine-walk; and the fact that she was merely tricking Dauban in order to wheedle the truth out of him had not helped her with her lover in the least.

The thrashing administered to Dauban had relieved some of Denys’ wrath; but the hard blows for him had been followed by some equally hard words for Lucette, with many hot and bitter reproaches: none the less stinging because for once undeserved. And she had not been able to make peace with him.

Worst of all, he had ridden away that morning without so much as a word to her; and she was angry at his obduracy and wounded by his neglect, and still more angry with herself for caring so much.

Gabrielle, quick to notice the troubles of those about her, had seen Lucette’s woe-begone, doleful looks and questioned her before the Duke’s visit; but now for the moment she was wholly engrossed by the perplexity in which that visit had left her.

“What can he want of me, Lucette?” she asked again and again, until Lucette had a suggestion to make, born of her own belief of the Duke’s purpose and intended as a warning for Gabrielle.

“Why not take counsel of the Duchess? She is a true friend of yours, Gabrielle, and a good woman.”

“It is a good thought. I will go to her to-day. I[44] would give half my wealth to do what he proposes—to have a voice even for no more than a few short years in governing the people. I could do so much good.”

“Would he keep his word, think you? I do not trust him. Truth and honour are not counted among his parts.”

“You are suspicious. Why?”

“To begin with, he is a man,” and Lucette nodded her head and stamped her foot petulantly.

“Not always a quick path to your disfavour, coz,” said Gabrielle with a smile. “Denys is a man.”

“Denys has a head of wood,” said Lucette, lapsing into her own wrongs for a moment.

“Seeing the infinite uses to which we turn wood, I know not why we always liken it to stupidity. Whatever our good Denys’ head may be, his heart is staunch and true.”

“We are not speaking of Denys but of the Duke, who has neither wooden head nor staunch heart—unless it be staunch to some cruel and treacherous purpose for his own game.”

“I fear there is truth in your words; yet he spoke me fairly.”

“Any man can do that,” exclaimed Lucette, with almost vicious emphasis. “But see the Duchess herself, tell her all that passed, and ask her. A wife should certainly know best how to interpret her husband’s words.”

The advice was given with so much eagerness that Gabrielle turned and looked searchingly into her friend’s eyes.

“Have you made a guess at his purpose and withhold it from me?” She asked so directly that Lucette winced, fearing that her own fears might be divined. She took shelter quickly in subterfuge, and lowering her eyes she dropped her head on Gabrielle’s shoulder and said with a deep sigh—“Oh, Gabrielle, I am not myself; I am the most miserable girl on earth.”

“What a thing of April weather is this love of yours! Smiles and tears, sunshine and drifting clouds; ever changing and plaguing, as it seems to me, coz.”

“You will know some day, Gabrielle.”

“I could hope not, indeed. It seems to me the world has sterner work for some of us women than to be plaguing our wits to please a man or pleasing ourselves by plaguing him. I would gladly give up all if I could help my people in Morvaix here. Little did the Duke think how nearly his offer touched me.”

“Did you think so sternly yesterday, Gabrielle, after that chance encounter in the market place?”

“If my thoughts wandered from my duty for an hour, a night’s reflection has corrected them,” answered Gabrielle slowly.

“The night had nothing but bitterness for me,” cried Lucette dismally. “And to-day Denys has ridden away without a word.”

“You should not provoke his anger against you so lightly.”

“There was no cause for it. He would be jealous of another man’s shadow,” said Lucette with a pout; and then with a quick change of mood, she cried: “Oh, how selfish I am; but how am I to tell you?”

“To tell me what?”

“I don’t know what name to give it, or how to speak of it. I was talking with Master Dauban, your uncle’s secretary——”

“So that was the cause of Denys’ anger! Lucette, Lucette!”

“I hate him; he is a loathsome creature.”

“Then why talk to him?”

“He made me talk to him by what he said.”

“Now of a truth you puzzle me.”

[46]“It is true. He spoke of some danger threatening Malincourt and you, and I did but try to get it from him. That was all.”

“You should not listen to tittle-tattle, coz.”

“He spoke of your betrothal to this M. de Cobalt—that there was some sinister meaning in it; that M. de Cobalt was no true man but a villain; and that others greater than he were concerned to do you harm through him. What could I do but listen and seek the truth?”

“You could have bid him hold his tongue for a mischief-making meddler in concerns that are none of his. Tell me no more of it, Lucette.”

“But he swore it was true, and that——”

“Peace, child; I will hear no more.”

“Gabrielle, you must,” cried Lucette, looking up. “It is true, and you must find out what it means.”

“Shall I give my hand to a man not trusting him?”

“Can you marry him knowing he is not true?”

“Lucette, you will make me lose patience. Would you have me deign to fret myself over the worrying of an idle gossip-monger?”

“Oh, it is terrible.”

“You are not yourself, child, and are frightened because you have angered Denys more deeply than usual. Come, let us go out into the bright sunshine and shake off these fretting fancies. You are always the slave of passing moods, Lucette,” she said, as they crossed the terrace and passed down the broad steps into the garden. “But out here in the sunshine you can most easily recover your spirits.”

“I am plagued with a fear of—I know not what,” answered Lucette, sighing dismally. “I wonder where Denys has gone.”

“He will come back, and as you are always telling me, all will come right, again.” She smiled but the smile ended in something like a sigh.

[47]She was indeed sorely perplexed by the course matters were taking, and although she would not acknowledge it, Lucette’s recital of Dauban’s warning had moved her considerably.

It fitted closely with her own feelings in regard to giving herself to a man she had never seen. Her pride of place and family had alone induced her to think of accepting the husband whom her mother had chosen for her; but it was not in human nature to acquiesce without murmurs and qualms and doubts and hesitation.

Moreover, the scene in the market place on the previous day had disturbed her profoundly, despite her stout assertion that the night’s reflection had restored her. Her couch had been the ground of a fierce battle between certain wild new-springing emotions and the set and sober thoughts of duty; and the fight had raged through the whole of a sleepless night.

In vain she had told herself over and over again that the stranger cavalier was nothing to her and could be nothing; that it was treachery to her dead mother even to let a thought of him force itself upon her; that it was unworthy, unmaidenly, and cowardly to be moved by the remembrance that a man had looked kindly into her eyes and that she had faltered before his glance; and this at the very moment when he to whom she was betrothed was coming to her.

She upbraided herself bitterly for her weakness, and rising from her couch had passed an hour or more on her knees in fervent prayer for strength to overcome the temptation which she found so alluring, and for power to subdue these new feelings as subtly sweet as they were strange and exciting.

Her heart would not be denied, however, and despite her most resolute efforts the recollection of the strong handsome face, with the clear steadfast blue eyes would[48] force itself back upon her again and again and yet again, despite her most earnest efforts.

In the morning when her uncle told her that he had heard of the stranger’s presence at Beaucamp and had despatched Denys in search of him, she was conscious that her heart fluttered almost wildly for the moment, and she had been compelled to turn her face away lest some of the emotion might make itself evident there.

“He must not think us thankless, uncle,” she had replied, calmly enough in tone; but in her heart she was driven to hope he would not be found and that never would she have to undergo the ordeal of meeting him face to face. What might then happen she did not dare to think.

But all this emotion she had hidden from even the sharp eyes of her companion, so that, although for her own secret reasons she was as eagerly impatient as Lucette herself for Denys’ return, her secret was locked away under an outward demeanour as calm and self-possessed as usual.

Twice she sent to inquire if he had come; pretending, even while despising herself for the pretence, that it was for Lucette’s sake; and when noon came and passed and he had not returned, she masked her own disappointment under a concern for Lucette.

But he did return at length, despite the Duke’s plans against him. Unconscious of the danger in which he rode he had by a mere chance change of direction evaded the two men sent to waylay him, and they had only ascertained the fact in time to admit of their following him to Malincourt in hot haste and mortal fear of the Governor’s anger.

They had wandered into a distant part of the grounds when Gabrielle caught sight of him pricking fast toward the maison, and she was at great pains to conceal the start she gave on seeing he was alone. She told herself[49] that she was glad he brought no one with him; but a little stinging stab of disappointment deep down in her heart and an eager, hungry desire to learn the news he brought, told a very different story.

Then Lucette caught sight of him.

“Look, Gabrielle, look. There rides Denys,” she cried excitedly.

“Where?” asked Gabrielle in a calm tone, feeling like a wicked hypocrite for her small pretence.

“There, there. I hope he will not see us,” exclaimed Lucette, pointing in his direction and making herself as conspicuous as possible.

“You are showing yourself plainly, Lucette.”

“Then he will know where not to come, if he is not in a better temper than this morning.”

Denys had seen Lucette. Gabrielle saw him turn and look toward them and then ride on toward the house without making a sign.

“He might have waved a hand,” said Lucette, pouting and shrugging her shoulders. “But I will punish him. Let us go away from here.”

“But just now you implied that he would not come here.”

“I will not forgive him easily if he does,” said Lucette, with a shake of the head and a little stamp of the foot.

“I will leave you to meet him, coz; and take my advice, cease to play this foolish game with him.”

“There are two other cavaliers riding this way,” said Lucette suddenly, “and spurring hard in urgent haste, it would seem.”

Had they not been so intent in watching these and speaking of Denys, they would have seen yet another cavalier who stepped for a moment from a belt of trees, looked eagerly in their direction, and then hurriedly hid himself.

Gabrielle, quite unconscious of this, continued to urge[50] Lucette to wait alone for Denys and seek to make her peace with him. But Lucette was obstinate; and when at length she caught sight of Denys in the distance, dust-stained with his long ride, walking in their direction, she drew Gabrielle hurriedly behind a clump of trees into hiding.

“We will see what he does,” she whispered excitedly. “I shall know by his face what mood he is in.”

When Denys reached the spot where they had been he paused and looked about him.

“It was here I saw her, I’ll swear,” he said aloud to himself. “I marked that old chestnut tree,” and he glanced at it. “Which way can she have gone? Lucette,” he called in a loud voice. “Lucette.” As he looked about him he backed close to the low trees behind which the two girls stood. “She can’t have wandered far. Lucette—Lucette,” he called again, and waited for his voice to come echoing back.

Then Lucette, whose face had brightened at hearing him call for her, plucked a rose from her bosom and tossed it so that it fell upon him in its course to the ground. He picked it up and smiled.

“A rose from an almond tree,” he said aloud. “Surely something of a strange portent. Where are you, Lucette; little witch, that changes the natural blooms of a tree?”

Lucette had stepped on a low bough of a tree and now looked through the bushes.

“I have dropped my rose, m’sieu. May I trouble you? Ah, M. Denys, is it you?” with a start of pretended surprise.

“Lucette,” he said passionately.

“Monsieur!” This distantly.

“Come, Lucette. Let the rose make our peace. I have been thinking of you through all my long ride.”

She came slowly toward him, parting the bushes and playing at indifference.

[51]“It is my rose, if you please, m’sieu.”

“But you meant it for me,” and he kissed it and then tried to take her hands. But she drew back.

“Do we know each other, m’sieu?”

His answer was a smile and an attempt to take her in his arms. But she would not let him. Seeing his mood, she could not resist a chance to tease him further.

“Have you forgotten what you said last night? Did you not ride off this morning without a word—a single word? Do you think I forgive so easily, and forget?”

“I can answer that, Denys,” said Gabrielle, stepping out now from her place of concealment. She was anxious to end the quarrel and learn the news he brought. “She has forgiven you and is sorry for what she did. She has been heart-broken all the morning at your absence.”

“Gabrielle, I——” began Lucette in protest.

“It is true, Denys, every word. So make your peace with her. Come, Lucette, be true to yourself.”

“Peacemaker as usual, mademoiselle,” cried Denys, with a happy, grateful smile.

“Indeed, indeed, it is nothing of the sort. Denys said last night that——”

“Never mind what I said in my anger, Lucette; I am sorry.”

“But it was so causeless, so unjust, so—so horrible,” and she put her hands to her ears as if in horror at the mere recollection.

Denys captured them then in his strong hands and held her a prisoner, while Gabrielle turned away.

“Let me go, Denys, let me go; how dare you!” cried Lucette, as if in anger, and commenced to struggle, tapping her foot and averting her head as he strove to kiss her. “Let me go I say.”

“Not till you say all that foolish quarrel is over, and you have kissed me.”

[52]“I will not. I will not. Let me go,” she cried, keeping up the pretence of anger.

“Kiss me then.”

“I will not. How dare you force me like this?”

And they were struggling in this way when a wholly unexpected and unwelcome interruption came.

“How dare you treat a girl like that?” demanded a man’s voice; and Antoine de Cavannes, followed by Henri d’Estelle, who had dogged Denys’ footsteps, rushed up and laid violent hands on his shoulder. “Oh, it’s you, Lucette,” continued Antoine, in anger and surprise. “Why didn’t you call me?”

Denys frowned darkly. He released Lucette, who fell back a step or two in disconcerted amazement.

“This is no concern of yours, gentlemen,” said Denys.

“Indeed, but it is. No cowardly cur shall maltreat a girl in our presence, eh, d’Estelle?” The two men exchanged meaning glances.

“Be careful of your words, m’sieu, if you please,” said Denys, his hand going involuntarily to his sword-belt.

“Careful with a blackguardly girl-beater like you. Be off about your business and leave mademoiselle with me.”

“By God!” cried Denys under his breath. “You shall eat those words, or I am no man.”

“Out on you for a braggart,” said Antoine, while his companion gave Denys a violent thrust.

“Be off with you, I say,” he exclaimed roughly.

In a moment Denys’ sword was out of its scabbard.

“No, no, Denys, you must not,” cried Lucette, now in dire consternation at the turn matters had taken.

“You’ve often told me of this fellow’s blackguard ways,” said Antoine. “It’s time he had a lesson how to behave.”

“Gabrielle, Gabrielle,” cried Lucette, catching sight of her. “Come here. Come here.”

[53]“Another petticoat for the coward to skulk behind,” said d’Estelle, with a coarse laugh.

“Gentlemen, you have made a great mistake,” cried Gabrielle, hastening forward. “This is not what you think. M. St. Jean is betrothed to Mademoiselle de Boisdegarde.”

“It had small appearance of it just now,” said d’Estelle.

“And I know it to be false,” declared Antoine.

“Monsieur!” exclaimed Gabrielle, drawing herself up.

“Mademoiselle!” answered d’Estelle, with insolent imitation of her tone.

The words were scarcely out of d’Estelle’s mouth before Denys strode forward and struck him a swinging left-handed blow across the mouth.

“You dog!” he said fiercely.

The two men drew then and were for attacking him together, but Lucette threw herself before him. Her wits, at first dazed by the dread of trouble to herself from the meeting of Antoine and Denys, were now sharpened by her fear for Denys’ sake from the unequal combat, and by a rapid intuition she jumped to the conclusion that the meeting was designed for her lover’s hurt.

“It shall not be. It is not fair—two to one. You cowards!” she cried, facing the couple angrily.

“Stand aside, Lucette,” said Denys, putting her away. “The thing has gone too far,” and choosing a spot which he deemed most to his advantage he put himself in an attitude of defence. “Now, messieurs, if you will.”

Lucette wrung her hands distractedly.

“They will kill him. They have come to do it. I know—I know,” she cried, until Gabrielle bade her run to the house and get help, when she set off with the speed of fear.

Denys was a good swordsman, and, having chosen his ground well, fought warily against the pair, who, over-eager to finish the thing before any help could come,[54] hampered each other, so that d’Estelle, getting in Antoine’s way, tripped and fell. His sword flew out of his hand and rolled close to Gabrielle, who instantly set her foot upon it.

The man scrambled quickly to his feet and ran to his sword.

“It is not fair, monsieur, two to one,” said Gabrielle angrily.

“Take your foot from my sword, mademoiselle,” he answered, a menace in both tone and look.

“I will not,” she answered as firmly as before.

“Then take the consequences,” he cried fiercely, and with a thrust he pushed her away, and snatching up his weapon, ran to the assistance of Antoine, whom Denys was now pressing fiercely in single combat.

“Help, help!” called Gabrielle in a loud voice. “Will no help come?”

But help was unexpectedly at hand, for another’s eyes had seen the dastardly attack of d’Estelle.

The stranger who had been in the wood had witnessed the last part of the quarrel, and when the two men commenced the attack upon Denys, he had started at a rapid run toward the scene.

A loud angry shout now proclaimed his arrival.

“You villain, to strike a woman. Two swords to one, gentlemen! This is murder, not fighting. Have a care, monsieur; that rascal is getting behind your back. Ah, a foul, treacherous stroke,” he exclaimed next, as d’Estelle, having crept up behind Denys, ran his blade into his back.

As Denys fell, the stranger gave another loud cry and leapt forward. Antoine was about to deliver another thrust while Denys lay on the ground, when his sword was parried by that of the newcomer.

“To me, messieurs, to me,” and the two men found themselves the objects of a rapid and vehement attack by[55] a swordsman vastly more skilful than themselves. In a minute d’Estelle was wounded with a slash on the sword-arm, and facing Antoine, the cavalier cried in a voice of thunder: “Now, you assassin, it is your turn.”

But Antoine, deserted by his comrade, who ran off as soon as he was wounded, had no heart to face the blade which played round him, threatening death at every flashing turn, gave ground and with a cry of terror, broke away and fled as fast as his legs would carry him.

His antagonist was following him, when there came a cry from Gabrielle.

“Monsieur—monsieur!”

He stopped at the words, turned, bared his head and bowed.

“Your pardon, mademoiselle. In my haste to punish a treacherous coward I was forgetting you were alone.”

“Monsieur,” said Gabrielle, now lowering her eyes in blushing confusion.

It was the cavalier who had rescued her the previous day in the market place; and the rush of thoughts held her tongue-tied in embarrassment.
